![forthebadge](https://forthebadge.com/images/badges/made-with-c-plus-plus.svg)


This research endeavor, conducted by __Dr. John LaRocco__, __Dr. Qudsia Tahmina__, and __John Simonis__ at The Ohio State University, is dedicated to the development of a novel fire extinguishing device. Specifically, the primary objective of this project is to construct a system that can be juxtaposed with a conventional vortex ring launcher. Electrolytic solution is aersolized and mixed in with the vortex ring creation and dispersed through the air.
